# Use MADR for architectural decisions

* Status: proposed
* Deciders: https://github.com/jamescrowley
* Date: 2019-05-11

## Context and Problem Statement

There may be many people working on Boxwise, with many different ideas about how we should solve our technical challenges.

Having a clear log of why decisions were made, and the constraints at the time, should hopefully help provide context for
new volunteers joining the project, and make it easier to judge when the original criteria / constraints are no longer 
relevant.

## Decision Drivers

* Record the information/context I (JC) have now built on the project, and document.
* We want to make it easy for others to join the project.

## Considered Options

* Record in Google Doc
* Record in Git (MADR - https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture_decision_record/blob/master/adr_template_by_michael_nygard.md)
* Record in Git (Simple ADR template - https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture_decision_record/blob/master/adr_template_madr.md)

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Record in Git", so that it lives alongside our code and is easy to share. The MADR format had more 'prompts' to think about, around alternatives and the consequences of that decision - and can still be deleted if not relevant.
